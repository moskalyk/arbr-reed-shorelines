Quantum computing has shown great promise in areas of chemistry, finding graphical ways to represent relationships from pieces of the whole of any new synthetic chemical conjuring. This project aims to combine this insight, zoomed out to the mythical level of individuals through the use of a tarot record keeping system for alchemical NFT morphology. 

The proposed application would be applied to the feed of algorithm for NFT referrals where a meta-space can be traversed through remixing of some global repair function for perpetual storage of culture keeping & sortition in patchwork like local governments.

## geospatial
The alchemical tool aims to use both geospatial information relating stewards with tree totems in various areas for the whereabouts of where individuals auras (psyches) live in a biology connected region.

With the development of cyborg like citizens, characterized as humans that are sensorially connected in some way with read & write capabilities for cognition & body networks, following such [protocols](https://www.are.na/block/14409277). In the autonomous guiding systems of navigating and constructing patchwork like community cohesion, I believe these types of tools will bne useufl in fullfilling the meaning derivation function for NFT consumption.

In a future driven by photonics, each card replicant can be a type of operating that runs on a far. [photonics](https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-photonic-age/)

To give some examples, I've joked with my neighbour many of times how some situation represents some card, or, that 'someone is 8 of cups'ing you'.
